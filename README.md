## filtrite
filtrite is a project for generating filter lists for [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) and [Cromite](https://www.cromite.org/). See the page about [Custom Ad Block Filters](https://www.bromite.org/custom-filters) for more info.

### Using your own filter lists
This program is designed in a way that allows easily adding new lists.

To create a new list:

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions by switching to the "Actions" tab of your repo, then confirming that you want to enable them
3. Choose a name for the list, e.g. in the following the name is `example-list`. Please note that the file name must end with `.txt`, so in our case we call it `example-list.txt` (put it in the `lists` directory).
4. Search for filter lists you want to use. You can for example find them [here](https://filterlists.com/), use those in "uBlock Origin" or "AdBlock Plus" format (however, it's possible that [not all types of rules are supported](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/AdBlocking)). Go to info, then "View" and copy the URL to the list.
5. Create a file `lists/example-list.txt` (in the `lists` directory) that contains the URLs to filter lists you copied before. It should look like this:
    ```
    # Lines starting with # are ignored, empty lines are also allowed
    # List one URL per line:
    https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt
    https://...

    # The following line doesn't work, only put either a comment or an URL in one line, not both
    http://  # Invalid comment on URL
    ```
6. Save your file, commit and push. GitHub Actions should now build the list and create a release
7. After GitHub Actions generated the release, you can copy the linked URL in the release to always get the latest generated version. This URL looks something like `https://github.com/USERNAME/filtrite/releases/latest/download/FILENAME.dat`. If your URL (except for the username/filename part) contains numbers, you copied the wrong link.
8. Check that the generated filter file size is less than the allowed maximum of [20 MB](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/6f40f8341ab3fbcab458c10fe7b6bbcb8f881404/build/patches/Bromite-subresource-adblocker.patch#L1160-L1161). If it isn't, you must remove some lists
9. Set this URL as the filter file in Bromite settings.

Another thing to note is that [GitHub disables scheduled workflows after 60 days](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow), meaning that you sometimes have to commit something to keep your fork "alive".
